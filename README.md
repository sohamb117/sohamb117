#### Hello...
#### It seems you've stumbled upon my profile...
#### I'm Soham Bhattacharya.

I write code. Mostly for fun.

I'm a 10th grade developer who loves making things, both hardware and software.


I mean... I don't really know what else to put here...

Take a look at my repos to see what I'm up to?

Want to collaborate? Email me at [sohamb117@gmail.com](mailto:sohamb117@gmail.com) or on Discord at sohamb117#4342.
I'm always online, so I should respond fairly quickly.
